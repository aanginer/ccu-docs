Printing
========

Printing in CCU is denoted with the ``/print`` command. In the command, you can add :doc:`variables <basic/var>` or :doc:`modifiers <basic/style>`

**example**
/print hello world

You might notice that ``/print`` does not directly print out the message. You must use the ``/end`` command to do that

**example**

``/print`` hello world

``/end``

**output**

hello world
